# English NHS costs by age, sex and deprivation

Code to calculate average population level NHS costs by age, sex and IMD quintile for patients in England with deprivation weights based on hospital episode statistics data from 2011/12

The Excel spreadsheet shows how these can be combined with primary care costs and extrapolated to other years of data. It also compares ONS costs by household income quintile for the UK with the estimated English NHS costs by neighbourhood deprivation quintile.

The results of this analysis were used in the following publication available [here](https://www.pssru.ac.uk/pub/uc/uc2017/asaria.pdf) with summary results available [here](https://www.pssru.ac.uk/pub/uc/uc2017/Miqdad-Asaria-results-tables.xlsx):
